# C++
During 2018–2019, I started learning my first programming language through [this video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQOaTSbfxUtCrKs0nicOg2npJQYSPGO9r) and the book [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://books.google.cz/books/about/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BD%D0%B0_C+.html?id=QKvIDQAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y).
